### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
nobel <- read_csv("data/nobel.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
```{r knowyourdata}
dim(nobel)
cat("Number of observations:", nrow(nobel), "\n")
cat("Number of variables:", ncol(nobel), "\n")
##there are 935 observations of 26 variables in the dataset.
##each row represents a Nobel Prize laureate 
```

### Exercise 2
```{r nobel-living1}
nobel_living <- nobel %>%
  filter(!is.na(country) & gender != "org" & is.na(died_date))
cat("Number of observations in nobel_living:", nrow(nobel_living))
```

### Exercise 3

```{r living Nobel laureates-US}
#First, weâ€™ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. 
nobel_living<-nobel_living %>%
  mutate (country_us = if_else (country == 'USA', "USA", "other"))

# Next, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.
nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Physics", "Medicine", "Chemistry", "Economics"))
```

```{r category-US}
#Create a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize.
ggplot (nobel_living_science, aes (x = country_us)) +
          facet_wrap(~category)+ # Facet by prize category
          geom_bar()+
          coord_flip() # Flip the coordinates to make the bars horizontal

#Economics shows a significant concentration of laureates in the US. Chemistry shows a more balanced distribution between laureates in the US and other countries
```
### Exercise 4
```{r US-based-born in other countries}
#Create a new variable called born_country_us that has the value "USA" if the laureate is born in the US, and "other" otherwise. 

nobel_living_science<-nobel_living_science %>%
  mutate (born_country_us = if_else (born_country == 'USA', "USA", "other"))
cat ("Number of winners in four categories born in the US", sum (nobel_living_science$born_country_us=="USA"))

```

### Exercise 5

```{r US-based-born in other countries2}
ggplot (nobel_living_science, aes (x = country_us, fill = born_country_us)) +
          facet_wrap(~category)+ # Facet by prize category
          geom_bar()+
          coord_flip() # Flip the coordinates to make the bars horizontal
# Buzzfeed highlighted that many of the U.S.-based Nobel laureates in the sciences were born outside the U.S. based on this visualization, a large portion of laureates residing in the U.S. were born outside the U.S. 
```

### Exercise 6

```{r immigrant Nobelists}
#within the four categories 
nobel_living_science %>%
  filter(country_us == "USA" & born_country_us == "other") %>%
  count(born_country) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))  # Sort by descending count
#Germany is the most common 
```

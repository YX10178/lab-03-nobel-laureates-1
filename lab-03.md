### Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
```

``` r
nobel <- read_csv("data/nobel.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

``` r
dim(nobel)
```

    ## [1] 935  26

``` r
cat("Number of observations:", nrow(nobel), "\n")
```

    ## Number of observations: 935

``` r
cat("Number of variables:", ncol(nobel), "\n")
```

    ## Number of variables: 26

``` r
##there are 935 observations of 26 variables in the dataset.
##each row represents a Nobel Prize laureate 
```

### Exercise 2

``` r
nobel_living <- nobel %>%
  filter(!is.na(country) & gender != "org" & is.na(died_date))
cat("Number of observations in nobel_living:", nrow(nobel_living))
```

    ## Number of observations in nobel_living: 228

### Exercise 3

``` r
#First, weâ€™ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. 
nobel_living<-nobel_living %>%
  mutate (country_us = if_else (country == 'USA', "USA", "other"))

# Next, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.
nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Physics", "Medicine", "Chemistry", "Economics"))
```

``` r
#Create a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize.
ggplot (nobel_living_science, aes (x = country_us)) +
          facet_wrap(~category)+ # Facet by prize category
          geom_bar()+
          coord_flip() # Flip the coordinates to make the bars horizontal
```

``` r
#Economics shows a significant concentration of laureates in the US. Chemistry shows a more balanced distribution between laureates in the US and other countries
```
